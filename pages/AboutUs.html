      <h3> who we are</h3>
        <p>
lovenské Vzdelávacie Centrum – South Manchester is a registered charity dedicated to preserving and promoting Slovak language and culture. We provide Slovak language education and organize cultural and community activities to help Slovak-speaking families maintain their heritage while living abroad.
While our primary focus is on supporting Slovak-speaking children and families, we warmly welcome anyone interested in learning the Slovak language and engaging with our traditions.
</p>
      <h3> Our mission</h3>
        <p> Our mission goes beyond just teaching the Slovak language. We are here to keep our heritage alive, help children abroad stay connected to their roots, and create a space where Slovak culture thrives—even far from home.
We believe that language is identity, history, and a sense of belonging. Our goal is to bring families together and help them navigate life between the UK and Slovakia while fostering a warm community.
</p>
      <h3>Our Journey</h3>  <p>
Founded by a team of passionate teachers, our centre became a registered charity on 9th September 2024 and officially launched on 15th September in collaboration with Slovak educational institutions. Since then, we've continued to grow and support the Slovak-speaking community through education, events, and support programs.</p>
