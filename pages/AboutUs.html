        <p>Who We Are
Slovenské Vzdelávacie Centrum – South Manchester is a registered charity dedicated to preserving and promoting Slovak language and culture. We provide Slovak language education and organize cultural and community activities to help Slovak-speaking families maintain their heritage while living abroad.
While our primary focus is on supporting Slovak-speaking children and families, we warmly welcome anyone interested in learning the Slovak language and engaging with our traditions. Beyond our Saturday school, we offer various workshops, events, and social activities where individuals of all ages can connect, learn, and take part in our cultural community.
</p>
        <p>Our Mission
Our mission is to: At Slovenské Vzdelávacie Centrum – South Manchester, our mission goes beyond just teaching the Slovak language. We are here to keep our heritage alive, to ensure that children growing up abroad don’t lose their connection to their roots, and to create a place where Slovak culture thrives—even far from home.
We believe that language is more than just words; it carries identity, history, and a sense of belonging. Through our work, we bring Slovak-speaking families together, helping them build friendships, strengthen their cultural ties, and feel at home even while living in the UK.
Education is at the heart of what we do, but our purpose extends even further. We are here to bridge the gap between the UK and Slovak education systems, ensuring that children who may one day return to Slovakia can transition smoothly. We are here to support families, guide them, and make sure no one feels lost when navigating life between two countries.
Above all, we are here to create a community—one that welcomes, supports, and celebrates Slovak language, traditions, and the people who cherish them.
</p>
        <p>Our Journey
Slovenské Vzdelávacie Centrum – South Manchester was founded by a group of dedicated teachers who shared a common vision—to establish a Slovak educational and cultural centre that truly makes a difference.
With a passion for teaching, culture, and community-building, we worked tirelessly to create a space where Slovak families could access quality education and cultural activities.
After months of hard work, we were proud to become a registered charity on 9th September 2024, marking a significant step in our journey. Our official launch on 15th September was a proud moment, celebrated in collaboration with the Faculty of Education from Univerzita Mateja Bela and the Association of Slovak Schools and Community Centres in the UK.
Since then, we have continued to grow, supporting Slovak-speaking families, students, and individuals who wish to learn, connect, and celebrate Slovak culture together.</p>
